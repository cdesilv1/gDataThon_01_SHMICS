Research Q: 

Advances is Machine Learning text-generation: An exploration in inflammatory political micro-blogging

- Business Understanding

Slowly, everything in our everyday lives is going online. Roughly 2/5 [41%](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/04/04/ecommerce-statistics) of US consumers order 1-2 packages from Amazon per week and a whopping 83% have made one purchase from Amazon within the last 6 months. This transfer to digital-life has come to the fore during the COVID-19 pandemic. Work, social events, even education has transfered online with the focus of social distancing. Although beneficial to curb the pandemic, social isolationism makes it difficult to keep meaningful social relationships, and many result to communication through digital media.

Digital media is the focus of our

# Code (50% of grade)

## General

- The project plan identifies criteria for successful completion of the project.
- README contains a concise project description and addresses each step in the CRISP-DM* process from business understanding to deployment 
- All assumptions are documented and next steps are laid out. 
- README and other project documentation is well-written, contains no spelling or grammatical errors, and ready for immediate review by potential employers 
- All files (including slides) are organized into directories and their locations are explained in the README 
- Final product addresses original business problem or research question.

## Use Case Understanding

- The project has the potential to provide benefit to users beyond just being interesting. (Is this project useful?) 
- Practical use is well articulated and demonstrated by project and project notes. (How well is this being explained as useful?) 
- The data set is put to good use in terms of practical application. (Is this the best use of your data set?)

## Data Prep

- The data preparation pipeline is documented in executable code contained in .py files. 

DATA SOURCE:
- Data source is clearly identified and credited. 
- Clear instructions are provided for obtaining the data and replicating the data preparation process. 
- Scripts are provided for obtaining the public data.
- A small representative shard of example data is included in the repository.

## Python Code

- All code is organized into functions and/or classes
- All Python code complies with PEP8 and passes pycode style. Docstrings are present and comply with Numpy or Google docstring style. Type annotations may be used. All inline comments are accurate and useful.
- All data preparation, modeling, and evaluation steps are documented in code. Another DSI graduate could reproduce the projectâ€™s results simply by following the instructions referenced in the README file.
- The repository is clean and does not contain unneccessary derived files and directories.  
- Modeling is done in .py files and not in jupyter notebooks

# Presentation (40%)

## Project Question/Goal

- Articulately and clearly describes the practical case of the project 
- Clearly articulates a question to be answered by the project  
- Identifies and articulates potential next steps

## EDA

- Identifies and describes the data source, crediting the data sources
- Demonstrates sufficient amount of analysis to properly identify data trends
- Demonstrates an understanding of the data as it relates to the project question

## Analysis (e.g. cleaning pipeline, modeling, validation of model, presentation of results)

- Chooses speaking points that are considered technologically interesting to the data science community; avoids topics that are considered common knowledge or uninteresting analysis
- Articulates metrics used for model validation 
- Presents modeling results in a way that is understandable to a technical and non-technical audience alike
- Final product addresses original business problem or research question.
